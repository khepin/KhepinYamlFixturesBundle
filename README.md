This bundles provides you with a way to use YAML based fixtures for Symfony2 and
Doctrine2. It currently works with either Doctrine ORM or Doctrine MongoDB ODM.
Other backend are not implemented yet but can be implemented very easily.

**Travic CI status:** [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/khepin/KhepinYamlFixturesBundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/khepin/KhepinYamlFixturesBundle)

# Installation

This bundle depends on the [DoctrineFixturesBundle](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html). If you don't have configured it
with Symfony2 yet, follow the
[setup instructions](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html#setup-and-configuration).

Through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), add to composer.json:

    "require": {
        "khepin/yaml-fixtures-bundle": "0.6.*"
    }

Then register the bundle in `AppKernel.php` it's better to only register it in
the dev environment as it shouldn't be needed elsewhere.

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'))) {
            //...
            $bundles[] = new Khepin\YamlFixturesBundle\KhepinYamlFixturesBundle();
            //...
        }
    }

# Configuration

In your `config.yml` or `config_dev.yml` (recommended) add the following:

    khepin_yaml_fixtures:
        resources:
            - MyBundle
            - MyOtherBundle


Under 'resources' is a list of the bundles that have fixtures that you wish to
load. The fixtures will be loaded in that order.

# Define your fixture files

It is important to note that unlike in Symfony1, the order in which you load your
fixtures DOES MATTER. There's 2 ways you can manipulate that order for now:

- In the configuration: to decide which bundles have their fixtures loaded first
- On the fixture file names: inside of each bundle, fixture files are loaded in
alphabetical order

By default, fixture files all go under `MyBundle/DataFixtures/somefixtures.yml`.

If you want to put your fixtures in a different directory, juste specify it in
your config:

    khepin_yaml_fixtures:
        directory: Resources/fixtures

You can only define fixtures for one class per file.

Fixture files are to be written in this format:

    model: Name\Space\MyBundle\Entity\User
    tags: [ test, dev, prod ] # optional parameter
    save_in_reverse: false # optional parameter
    persistence: orm (default)| mongodb # lets you choose if these fixtures should be saved through the orm or through mongodb.
    fixtures:
        michael:
            name: Michael
            phonenumber: 8765658
            birthday: "1989-12-12"

You can use references to previously created fixtures:

    model: Name\Space\MyBundle\Entity\Car
    fixtures:
        audi_a3:
            owner: michael
            since: "2010-12-12" #dates NEED to be set inside quotes

For MongoDB's reference many, just put a list of references:

    model: Name\Space\Bundle\Document\Car
    persistence: mongodb
    fixtures:
        audi_a3:
            owners:
                - michael
                - paul
                - angella

You can also define as many files as you want for the same entity. This will be
useful when used together with context tags (see below).

## Mongo embedded documents

It's possible to use embedded documents in mongo (only embed_one is implemented
at this time). Just keep cascading your yaml file like this:

    model: Name\Space\Bundle\Document\Article
    persistence: mongodb
    fixtures:
        first_post:
            title: Ouelkom to my niew blog!
            content: I will update regularly!
            author: # This defines an embedded document
                name: khepin # this will be set on the embedded document

# Usage

## From the command line

    php app/console khepin:yamlfixtures:load <context>

More later regarding contexts, there is no need to add a context unless you have
a reason to.

**ATTENTION**: the command line can only load one context at a time for now.

## From anywhere else

If you need to load the fixtures from anywhere else like say ... your functional
tests in order to setup a clean database for testing, you can access the same thing
through the service container with the added advantage of being able to load
multiple contexts together:

    $container->get('khepin.yaml_loader')->loadFixtures('prod', 'test', ...);

## About contexts

Sometimes when setting up fixtures for testing purpose, you need to have different
configurations. This is what the context aims to help solving.

The contexts are equivalent to the tags set in the fixture file under the tag key.
You can set as many tags as you want on a fixture file. Such as `prod`, `test` etc...

If you define fixtures in this way, then from the command line, calling:

    php app/console khepin:yamlfixtures:load prod

All the fixture files for which you have set:

    tags: [ ..., prod, ... ]

Will be loaded. This way you can define fixtures that are loaded whenever you use
a test or dev environment but are not loaded in prod for example.

A fixture file with no tags at all is **always** loaded! This way you can setup your
bootstrapping fixtures in files that have absolutely no tags and then have fixtures
specific for each purpose.

## And what the heck is this "save_in_reverse" thingy?

This parameter can be omitted most of the time. It's only useful so far when you
have a self referencing table. For example if you had fixtures like this:

    fixtures:
        last_level:
            next_level: none
            name: Meet the boss
        middle_level:
            next_level: last_level
            name: complete the quest
        start_level:
            next_level: middle_level
            name: introduction

In this case, we need to put `last_level` first in our fixtures since it's the only
one that doesn't reference anything else. We could not create `start_level` first
because it needs `middle_level` to already exist etc...

The problem with this is that when purging the database, the ORMPurger() goes through
rows one by one ordered by their ids. So if we save them in this order, `last_level`
should be the first to go away which will cause a problems with foreign keys as it is
still referenced by `middle_level`.

Save in reverse will create the objects in this order so the references are set
properly and then save them in the opposite order so there is no exception when
purging the database.

## Handling ORM One-To-Many or Many-To-Many Associations

If you want to pass an array of already created objects to a *-To-Many assocation, you
can do this by first allowing your setter on the object to accept a plain PHP array
(as opposed to only accepting a Doctrine\Common\ArrayCollection) and then define your
YAML file as follows:

    fixtures:
        car:
            name: foo_bar
            parts:
                - part_one
                - part_two
                - part_three

This is assuming of course that part_one, part_two, and part_three are objects you
already defined in previously loaded files.

The YAML loader will create a plain PHP array of the three objects and pass it to,
for example, setParts() on the model you are defining in this file.

## Service calls

Some entities require being managed by a special service before they can be persisted.
This is the case with FOSUserBundle for example where the right password is set
by the `user_manager` and not directly in the user class. Therefore we need to
ask this service to set our domain object in the correct state before it can be
persisted. Service calls are declared this way:

    model: My\NameSpace\User
    service_calls:
        service_1:
            service: fos_user.user_manager # this is the service id in the container
            method: updateUser # the method to be called on the object
    fixtures:
      dad:
        name: Francois
        plain_password: thisismypassword

Now for each user, before it is persisted, something equivalent to the following
code will happen:

    $container->get('fos_user.user_manager')->updateUser($user_francois);

## Using ACLs

If you need to set ACL entries on your fixtures, it is possible. The ACLs are
created after all fixtures have been saved so that there is no possible conflict.

To set ACLs for the fixtures, you need to be using
[ProblematicAclManagerBundle](problematic/ProblematicAclManagerBundle).

And to update your configuratin as follows:

    khepin_yaml_fixtures:
        acl_manager: ~
        resources:
            - MyBundle
            - MyOtherBundle

The ACLs can only use the standard defined masks from the Symfony MaskBuilder.
Example:

    model: My\NameSpace\Car
    tags: [ test ]
    fixtures:
      dad_car:
        name: Mercedes
      mom_car:
        name: Mini Cooper

    acl:
      dad_car:
        user_dad: MASK_OWNER
        user_mom: MASK_MASTER
      mom_car:
        user_mom: MASK_OWNER

Be careful that the ACLs in Symfony are not managed through Doctrine and
therefore will not be purged when you re-create your fixtures. However if
any conflicts, loading the ACLs will overwrite all previous ACL entries.
